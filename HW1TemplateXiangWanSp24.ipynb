Color conversions.  (11 points)\n","(This problem comes from Introduction to Programming in Python, by Sedgewick, Wayne and Dondero)\n","\n","Several different formats are used to represent color. For example, the primary format for LCD displays, digital cameras, and web pages, known as the RGB format, specifies the level of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) on an integer scale from 0 to 255. The primary format for publishing books and magazines, known as the CMYK format, specifies the level of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K) on a real scale from 0.0 to 1.0. Compose a program that converts RGB to CMYK. Accept three integers —r, g, and b —from the command line and write the equivalent CMYK values. If the RGB values are all 0, then the CMY values are all 0 and the K value is 1; otherwise, use these formulas (written mathematically - you need to translate to code, think about the types of r, g, b, c, m, y, k, w):\n","\n","w = maximum(r/255, g/255, b/255)\n","\n","c = (w - r/255) / w\n","\n","m = (w - g/255) / w\n","\n","y = (w - b/255) / w\n","\n","k = 1 - w\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oWRb6QxO21Nw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Check your answers - and see colors\n","\n","https://g.co/kgs/hdYibu"],"metadata":{"id":"cVS4fJ_6xtRa"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_6QBMgVSpgcg"},"outputs":[],"source":["# prompt the user and read in integer value for r, g and b\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# Compute the values for w, c, m, k, y.
